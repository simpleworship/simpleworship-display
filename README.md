This is a simple display application for [SimpleWorship](https://github.com/simpleworship/simpleworship) that finds running instances using SSDP and loads them.

By default it will auto-load the first display it finds, while also giving you a context menu to change displays (and other settings) when you click anywhere on the screen.
